The objectives of this projecy are to:
1. build a neural network for a text sentiment classification task 
2. practice tuning model hyper-parameters

# Read about the CodaBench Competition

This was a class-wide competition.
The competition website is: [https://www.codabench.org](https://www.codabench.org)

As part of a class competition, I developed and fine-tuned a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify image data, ultimately achieving an accuracy of 82%. Through iterative optimization and careful parameter tuning, I was able to significantly improve the modelâ€™s performance and ranked within the top 10 participants in the competition. 

This experience strengthened my understanding of deep learning workflows and highlighted the importance of model evaluation and refinement in achieving competitive results.
